<p>logstash is a tool for managing events and logs. You can use it to collect logs, parse them, and store them for later use (like, for searching). Speaking of searching, logstash comes with a web interface for searching and drilling into all of your logs.</p>

<p>It is fully free and fully open source. The license is New BSD, meaning you are pretty much free to use it however you want in whatever way.</p>

<h2>Ship logs from any source, parse them, get the right timestamp, index them, and search them.</h2>

<p>All your logs from all over your infrastructure in one place - with searching and graphing. Since we can easily parse text-based logs, you can query for more precise things like, all 404 http errors, nagios critical alerts in hard state, or mail server faults - all without accidentally finding logs with the word ‘404’ or ‘critical’ in the wrong place.
