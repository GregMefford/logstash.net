<h2>date</h2>

The date filter is used for parsing dates from fields and using that
date or timestamp as the timestamp for the event.

For example, syslog events usually have timestamps like this:
  "Apr  7 09:32:01"

You would use the date format "MMM dd HH:mm:ss" to parse this.

The date filter is especially important for sorting events and for
backfilling old data. If you don't get the date correct in your
event, then searching for them later will likely sort out of order.

In the absense of this filter, logstash will choose a timestamp based on the
first time it sees the event (at input time), if the timestamp is not already
set in the event. For example, with file input, the timestamp is set to the
time of reading.

<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>
filters {
  date {
    <a href="#setting_(?-mix:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)">(?-mix:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)</a> => ... # array
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3> Details </h3>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_(?-mix:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)">
    (?-mix:[A-Za-z0-9_-]+)
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is array </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

Config for date is:
  fieldname => dateformat

The same field can be specified multiple times (or multiple dateformats for
the same field) do try different time formats; first success wins.

The date formats allowed are the string 'ISO8601' or whatever is supported
by Joda; generally: [java.text.SimpleDateFormat][dateformats]

For example, if you have a field 'logdate' and with a value that looks like 'Aug 13 2010 00:03:44'
you would use this configuration:

    logdate => "MMM dd yyyy HH:mm:ss"
