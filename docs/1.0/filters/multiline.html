multiline filter

This filter will collapse multiline messages into a single event.

The multiline filter is for combining multiple events from a single source
into the same event.

The original goal of this filter was to allow joining of multi-line messages
from files into a single event. For example - joining java exception and
stacktrace messages into a single event.

TODO(sissel): Document any issues?
The config looks like this:

    filters {
      multiline {
        type => "type"
        pattern => "pattern, a regexp"
        negate => boolean
        what => "previous" or "next"
      }
    }

The 'regexp' should match what you believe to be an indicator that
the field is part of a multi-line event

The 'what' must be "previous" or "next" and indicates the relation
to the multi-line event.

The 'negate' can be "true" or "false" (defaults false). If true, a 
message not matching the pattern will constitute a match of the multiline
filter and the what will be applied. (vice-versa is also true)

For example, java stack traces are multiline and usually have the message
starting at the far-left, then each subsequent line indented. Do this:

    filters {
      multiline {
        type => "somefiletype"
        pattern => "^\\s"
        what => "previous"
      }
    }
    
This says that any line starting with whitespace belongs to the previous line.

Another example is C line continuations (backslash). Here's how to do that:

    filters {
      multiline {
        type => "somefiletype "
        pattern => "\\$"
        what => "next"
      }
    }
    

<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>
filters {
  multiline {
    <a href="#setting_negate">negate</a> => ... # boolean
    <a href="#setting_pattern">pattern</a> => ... # string
    <a href="#setting_what">what</a> => ... # previousnext
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3> Details </h3>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_negate">
    negate
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is boolean </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

Negate the regexp pattern ('if not matched')

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_pattern">
    pattern
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is string </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

The regular expression to match

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_what">
    what
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value can be any of: "previous", "next" </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

If the pattern matched, does event belong to the next or previous event?
