<h2>multiline</h2>

<p>multiline filter</p>

<p>This filter will collapse multiline messages into a single event.</p>

<p>The multiline filter is for combining multiple events from a single source
into the same event.</p>

<p>The original goal of this filter was to allow joining of multi-line messages
from files into a single event. For example - joining java exception and
stacktrace messages into a single event.</p>

<p>TODO(sissel): Document any issues?
The config looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>filters {
  multiline {
    type =&gt; "type"
    pattern =&gt; "pattern, a regexp"
    negate =&gt; boolean
    what =&gt; "previous" or "next"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The 'regexp' should match what you believe to be an indicator that
the field is part of a multi-line event</p>

<p>The 'what' must be "previous" or "next" and indicates the relation
to the multi-line event.</p>

<p>The 'negate' can be "true" or "false" (defaults false). If true, a
message not matching the pattern will constitute a match of the multiline
filter and the what will be applied. (vice-versa is also true)</p>

<p>For example, java stack traces are multiline and usually have the message
starting at the far-left, then each subsequent line indented. Do this:</p>

<pre><code>filters {
  multiline {
    type =&gt; "somefiletype"
    pattern =&gt; "^\\s"
    what =&gt; "previous"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This says that any line starting with whitespace belongs to the previous line.</p>

<p>Another example is C line continuations (backslash). Here's how to do that:</p>

<pre><code>filters {
  multiline {
    type =&gt; "somefiletype "
    pattern =&gt; "\\$"
    what =&gt; "next"
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>
filters {
  multiline {
    <a href="#setting_negate">negate</a> => ... # boolean
    <a href="#setting_pattern">pattern</a> => ... # string
    <a href="#setting_what">what</a> => ... # previousnext
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3> Details </h3>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_negate">
    negate
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is boolean </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

<p>Negate the regexp pattern ('if not matched')</p>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_pattern">
    pattern
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is string </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

<p>The regular expression to match</p>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_what">
    what
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value can be any of: "previous", "next" </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

<p>If the pattern matched, does event belong to the next or previous event?</p>
