<h2>stdin</h2>

<p>Read events from standard input.</p>

<p>By default, each event is assumed to be one line. If you
want to join lines, you'll want to use the multiline filter.</p>

<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>
inputs {
  stdin {
  }
}
</code></pre>
