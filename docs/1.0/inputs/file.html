<h2>file</h2>

<p>Stream events from files.</p>

<p>By default, each event is assumed to be one line. If you
want to join lines, you'll want to use the multiline filter.</p>

<p>Files are followed in a manner similar to "tail -0F". File rotation
is detected and handled by this input.</p>


<h3> Synopsis </h3>

This is what it might look like in your config file:

<pre><code>
inputs {
  file {
    <a href="#setting_exclude">exclude</a> => ... # array
    <a href="#setting_path">path</a> => ... # array (required)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h3> Details </h3>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_exclude">
    exclude
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is array </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

<p>Exclusions. Globs are valid here, too.
For example, if you have</p>

<pre><code>path =&gt; "/var/log/*"
</code></pre>

<p>you might want to exclude gzipped files:</p>

<pre><code>exclude =&gt; "*.gz"
</code></pre>

<h4> 
  <a name="setting_path">
    path (required setting)
</a>
</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Value type is array </li>
  <li> There is no default value for this setting. </li>
</ul>

<p>The path to the file to use as an input.
You can use globs here, such as "/var/log/*.log"</p>
